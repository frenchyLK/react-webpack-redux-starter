  Configuration of our routes. We've opted to stick routing for individual sub-routes
  in their "parent" components; but theres nothing stoping you from defining them in here.
  We are syncronously loading the "App" component as its the root component for the
  entire application.

  The sub-routes we've defined take in the store becasue they
  define their routes asyncronously. Go take a look at the Counter route code
  for more information.
